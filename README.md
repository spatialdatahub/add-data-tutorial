For this example we have provided a dataset with 100 hapahazardly created points. The raw dataset is in this repository and can be found at this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spatialdatahub/spatialdatahub-tutorial/master/onehundredpoints.geojson). Copy the address for the link from your search bar and paste it into the "Url" field on the "Add New Dataset" page.
